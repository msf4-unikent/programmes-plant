It is the study of human beings: how we evolved, why we live in different sorts of societies around the world, and how we interact with one another and the environment. An exciting and varied subject, anthropology covers a huge number of topics including human evolution, primatology, genetics, reproduction, nutrition, religion, kinship, politics and development.\r\n\r\nAt Kent, we offer a BSc degree in Anthropology that integrates the biological and social sides of the discipline; one of the very few departments in the UK to do so. Ours is a broad-ranging degree, both flexible and modular – you get to shape your own course through your choice of modules - but designed to ensure that whatever your choices, you receive a top quality education and the skills you need to succeed in the workplace.\r\n\r\nThis is an ideal degree whether you have an arts, humanities or science background. Anthropology draws on each of these and, by the end of your degree, you will have a thorough understanding of your own species.',1,1,1,7,'',1,'L601','','','3 years','Here is some fee content','On average, you have four hours of lectures and six hours of seminars and/or lab sessions each week. For the Project in Anthropological Science, you receive regular one-to-one supervision.\r\n\r\nThe School of Anthropology and Conservation has a specialist teaching lab that provides equipment and specimens for teaching and research use. This lab has a completely integrated audiovisual system, providing cutting-edge lectures, and is primarily used by BSc students. You have access to an excellent fossil cast collection with more than 50 casts of extant and extinct primates and hominins, including an entire Homo erectus skeleton.\r\n\r\nWe are associated with the nearby Quex Museum, which has one of the largest collections of primate skeletal remains in the world, as well as an extensive collection of cultural artefacts to which undergraduates have access. We have dedicated computing facilities within the School, in addition to the general University IT provision, a darkroom, and an ethnobiology lab for studying human-related plant material.\r\n\r\nMany of the core modules have an end-of-year examination which counts for 50% to 100% of your final mark for that module. The remaining percentage comes from practical or coursework marks. However, others, such as the Project in Anthropological Science are assessed entirely on coursework. Both Stage 2 and 3 marks and, where appropriate, the marks from your year abroad, count towards your final degree result.','Studying anthropology gives you an exciting range of career opportunities. We work with you to help direct your module choices to the career paths you are considering. Through your studies, you learn how to work independently, to analyse complex data and to present your work with clarity and flair.\r\n\r\nOur graduates have gone on to careers in advertising; education; social work; town and country planning; housing and personnel management; journalism, film production, or research for radio and television programmes; consultancy in overseas development and relief agencies; science journalism; museum work; forensic science; business and the Civil Service.','Passing the Kent IFP with an overall average of 60%, including passing all components and achieving a mark of 60% in the mathematics and quantitative methods, and academic skills modules, guarantees you entry onto the first year of the L601 degree programme.','AAB at A level, IB Diploma 33 points or 17 points at HL, inc 4 in Mathematics (5 in Mathematic Studies) and 4 in a science subject.','GCSE English Language (IB equivalent) and Mathematics grade C, GCSE single or double science grade B.','We also consider students with alternative qualifications.','Here is some apply content','For those considering this programme we recommend you download the subject leaflet because it will give you a lot more information about it.

It is the study of human beings: how we evolved, why we live in different sorts of societies around the world, and how we interact with one another and the environment. An exciting and varied subject, anthropology covers a huge number of topics including human evolution, primatology, genetics, reproduction, nutrition, religion, kinship, politics and development.\r\n\r\nAt Kent, we offer a BSc degree in Anthropology that integrates the biological and social sides of the discipline; one of the very few departments in the UK to do so. Ours is a broad-ranging degree, both flexible and modular – you get to shape your own course through your choice of modules - but designed to ensure that whatever your choices, you receive a top quality education and the skills you need to succeed in the workplace.\r\n\r\nThis is an ideal degree whether you have an arts, humanities or science background. Anthropology draws on each of these and, by the end of your degree, you will have a thorough understanding of your own species.',1,1,1,7,'draft',6,1,'L601','','','3 years','Here is some fee content','On average, you have four hours of lectures and six hours of seminars and/or lab sessions each week. For the Project in Anthropological Science, you receive regular one-to-one supervision.\r\n\r\nThe School of Anthropology and Conservation has a specialist teaching lab that provides equipment and specimens for teaching and research use. This lab has a completely integrated audiovisual system, providing cutting-edge lectures, and is primarily used by BSc students. You have access to an excellent fossil cast collection with more than 50 casts of extant and extinct primates and hominins, including an entire Homo erectus skeleton.\r\n\r\nWe are associated with the nearby Quex Museum, which has one of the largest collections of primate skeletal remains in the world, as well as an extensive collection of cultural artefacts to which undergraduates have access. We have dedicated computing facilities within the School, in addition to the general University IT provision, a darkroom, and an ethnobiology lab for studying human-related plant material.\r\n\r\nMany of the core modules have an end-of-year examination which counts for 50% to 100% of your final mark for that module. The remaining percentage comes from practical or coursework marks. However, others, such as the Project in Anthropological Science are assessed entirely on coursework. Both Stage 2 and 3 marks and, where appropriate, the marks from your year abroad, count towards your final degree result.','Studying anthropology gives you an exciting range of career opportunities. We work with you to help direct your module choices to the career paths you are considering. Through your studies, you learn how to work independently, to analyse complex data and to present your work with clarity and flair.\r\n\r\nOur graduates have gone on to careers in advertising; education; social work; town and country planning; housing and personnel management; journalism, film production, or research for radio and television programmes; consultancy in overseas development and relief agencies; science journalism; museum work; forensic science; business and the Civil Service.','Passing the Kent IFP with an overall average of 60%, including passing all components and achieving a mark of 60% in the mathematics and quantitative methods, and academic skills modules, guarantees you entry onto the first year of the L601 degree programme.','AAB at A level, IB Diploma 33 points or 17 points at HL, inc 4 in Mathematics (5 in Mathematic Studies) and 4 in a science subject.','GCSE English Language (IB equivalent) and Mathematics grade C, GCSE single or double science grade B.','We also consider students with alternative qualifications.','Here is some apply content','For those considering this programme we recommend you download the subject leaflet because it will give you a lot more information about it.
