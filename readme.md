# Programmes Plant

A replacement for the Programmes Factory, written using [Laravel](http://laravel.com) and using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

Part of the [XCRI project at the University of Kent](http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/kent-xcri/).

## Development

The following are instructions on running the Programmes Plant on a local machine for development.

1. Clone this repository. Obtain Laravel as a submodule by running `git submodule init`, unless you have done a recursive clone.

2. You need to setup the application by editing all the sample files in `config/` and moving them to `config/local/` filling in as appropriate. 

To move the files in one command, run:
`mkdir application/config/local && cp application/config/*.sample application/config/local && ls application/config/local/*.sample | while read file; do echo $file  `echo $file | sed s/.sample//`; done`

3. You will need to create a MySQL database if you plan to use MySQL. Create this database and add the credentials to `application/config/local/database.php`.

4. The application requires an authentication driver to be used. The details of this can be setup in `application/config/local/auth.php`. We use our own LDAP driver. If you decide to use our bundled LDAP driver, the server settings can go in `application/config/local/ldap.php`.

5. Programmes Plant uses PHP Session based session driver as a drop in replacement for the Laravel default. This needs to be setup in `application/config/local/session.php` specifying a cookie type.

6. Run `php artisan migrate:install --env=local` to setup the migtations table. Then run `php artisan migrate --env=local` to run all the migrations to setup your database.

7. Copy the public/.htaccess.sample file to public/.htaccess.

8. Point a browser at the public folder.

9 We're done here!
