# Programmes Factory 2.0

A replacement for the Programmes Factory, written in Laravel and using Twitter Bootstrap.

Part of the XCRI project at the University of Kent.

## Development

First obtain Laravel as a submodule by running `git submodule init`.

Then you need to setup the application by editing all the sample files in `config/` and moving them to `config/local/` filling in as appropriate.

Finally you need to run all the migrations in order to setup the databases.
