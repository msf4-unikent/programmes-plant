# Programmes Factory 2.0

A replacement for the Programmes Factory, written using [Laravel](http://laravel.com) and using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

Part of the [XCRI project at the University of Kent](http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/kent-xcri/).

## Development

First obtain Laravel as a submodule by running `git submodule init`.

Then you need to setup the application by editing all the sample files in `config/` and moving them to `config/local/` filling in as appropriate.

Finally you need to run all the migrations in order to setup the databases.
